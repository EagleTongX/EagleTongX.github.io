Knowledge compound: Learning one new idea won't make you genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative.

It builds up, like compound interest." - Warren Buffett.

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals, focusing on your system instead. Goals are good for setting a direction, but system are best for making progress.

- Small habits don't add up. They compound.
