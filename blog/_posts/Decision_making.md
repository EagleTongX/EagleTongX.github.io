### The Munger Two Step
A simple and easy approach to decision making that prevents us from being manipulated.
1. Understand the force at play.
2. Understand how your subconscious might be leading your astray.


1. What are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? 
2. Waht are the subconscious doing these things-which by and large are useful, but which often misfunction. 

"One approach is rationality-the way youâ€™d work out a bridge problem: by evaluating the real interests, the real probabilities and so forth. And the other is to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subconscious conclusions-many of which are wrong."

The key of the first step is knowing what you know and what you don't know. To make consistently good decisions, you need to develop a deep fluency iin the area in which you are making decisions, and you need to pull in the big ideas from multiple disciplines to make sure you're exercising good judgment. 

Your subconscious mind is larger than your conscious mind.
