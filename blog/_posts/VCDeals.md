## Inside a Venture Capital Fund
- How VCs make money?
VCs make money by having other investors to invest in their capitals so they can invest yours. VC raise fund from pension plan, corporates, family offices, etc.

Two ways of VC making money:
1. Management Fee
2. Carried interest(carry): e.g. you take 100M from investor, return 100M and 80% of the profit go to LP, 20% go to GP. 

VC are driven by multiples on their fund
The investment is a slow-feedback loop 

Investor Mindest
1. 7 out of 10 protfolio companies will go to zero
2. Time diversification and sector diversification to mitigate risk
3. Portfolio

When you are approaching investors, their mindest is going to be about reducing risk, team makeup, and how your company can return to their fund and the LPs. 

Some basic things you can do to reduce risk with investors: 
- Data room - get your house in order.
- Show customer traction - whether that be data non-paying or paying, you want to show signs of life and your customers find the product delightful
- Show the risk - mitigating milestones you've accomplished without funding 
- Show any partnerships 


Fund lifecycle:
Ten year life 
Where the VC is and where their fund is in there 10 year cycle. 

### Corporate Venture Capital (CVC)
Things to consider before taking a CVC investment: 
- Is your technology a fit for that company where their product roadmap is going or used within their enterprise?
- How do they make their decisions if they are financially motivated? 
- How will taking their money impact future investment and the construction of your board? 

**Portfolio Construction**
When you're vetting a fund, figure out when that investor last raised their fund and the "vintage" of that fund. You'll also want to understand what year they made investments out of that fund. This will indicate if the investor may or may not be able to fund your company. 

**Questions you can ask a potential investor about their fund:**
1. Where are you in the fund lifecycle?
2. What's the length of your fund?
3. Can you tell me more about the fund you're working with now?
4. Are you raising another fund - if so how soon do you plan on closing?
5. What percentage of the time do you follow on with a 2nd and 3rd investment?

- The highest price, may not be the best value add investor, you have to identify what's important to the growth of your business.


**VC values companies on a number of factors:**
- Stage of company
- Competition with other funding sources
- Experience of the entrepreneurs and leadership team
- Size and trendiness of the market
- The venture capitalist's natural entry point
