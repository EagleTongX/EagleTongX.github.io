**The way to figure out what to work on is by working**

It's fine to guess your interest wrong, some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields.

Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do. 

Always preserve excitingness.


What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.

**Find what you excessively interested in -> learn enough knowledge about it -> notice gap -> explore promising ones.**

Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted.

Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could.

The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information.

The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.

It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted that the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow magically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does.

Principle of serendipity: Ludy luck favors who tries 

When you don't know what to work on, be curious, try a lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions. 

When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like. But a field should become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.

If you're making something for people, make sure it's something they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience.

If you're interested, you're not astray.

I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future.

The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on?


Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you're surprised how far you've come.

Consistency: People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.

If you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good. 

Don't try to work in a disctinctive style, just try to do the best job you can. 

Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind.
