目的地无关紧要，只要到了那条奔腾不息的河上，知道自己在航行，心里就踏实了 - 博尔赫斯

“That must be the story of innumerable couples, and the pattern of life it offers has a homely grace. It reminds you of a placid rivulet, meandering smoothly through green pastures and shaded by pleasant trees, till at least it falls into the vasty sea; but the sea is so calm, so silent, so indifferent, that you are troubled suddenly by a vague uneasiness. Perhaps it is only by a kink in my nature, strong in me even in those days, that I felt in such an existence, the share of the great majority, something amiss. I recognized its social values, I saw its ordered happiness, but a fever in my blood asked for wilder course. There seemed to me something alarming in such easy delights. In my heart was a desire to live more dangerously. I was not unprepared of jagged rocks and treacherous shoals if I could only have change - change and the excitement of the unforeseen."

“这一定是世间无数对夫妻的写照，这种生活模式给人以安详亲切之感。它让人联想到一条平静的小溪，蜿蜒流过青青的牧场，与郁郁的树荫交相掩映，直到最后汇入烟波浩渺的大海中。但是大海却总是那么平静，始终沉默，不动声色，你会突然心生烦恼，感到莫名的不安。也许这只是我自己的一种怪想法，我总觉得大多数人这样度过一生好像欠缺了一点什么。我承认这种生活的社会价值，也看到了它井然有序的幸福，但是，我的血液里有一种强烈的冲动，渴望一种更桀骜不驯的旅途。这种安详宁静的快乐好像有一种叫我惊惧不安的东西。我的心渴望更加惊险的生活。 只要我能有所改变 - 改变和不可预知的冒险，我将踏上嶙峋怪石，哪怕激流险滩。"
